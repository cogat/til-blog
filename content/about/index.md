I am a technology coach, strategist and maker. I bring curiosity, awareness and action to technology teams as they dance with culture and society.

When I'm at my best, you'll see me:

* Amplifying, coaching and mentoring software engineering leaders. My approach uses curiosity, empathy and encouragement to support the self-evolution of people and organisational systems.
* Calmly, confidently and positively stewarding people and technology, within complex and ambiguous landscapes.
* Prioritising creativity, diversity, equality and inclusion, by courageously leaning in.

I also very much enjoy writing code (Python + JS, mainly), writing helpful things, entertaining, reading, patting cats, shunning dogs, and the occasional newspaper puzzle.

# My career in a nutshell

* **2021&ndash;now: Software Engineering Lead at [Kraken Tech](https://kraken.tech)**, the technology part of Octopus Energy Group. I lead a team working across Asia-Pacific, creating software to help accelerate the world's transition to renewable energy.
* **2020&ndash;now: [Principal at Robots for the People](https://robotsforthepeople.com)**, my consultancy hustle. I worked with Collaboration for Impact on their digital strategy, my brother on our pandemic startup idea, and SHIPS Psychology on their process automation.
* **2017&ndash;2020: Chief Technology Officer at the [Australian Centre for the Moving Image](https://acmi.net.au)**. I directed the museum's $7.2m technology transformation, using internet-of-things to reach audiences and lower operating costs.
* **2007&ndash;2017: Founder and CEO at the [Interaction Consortium](https://interaction.net.au)**, a digital consultancy serving recognised cultural institutions and brands in Australia and globally. Everyone wins awards, but not many people get their work used by Apple in their ads!
* **2003&ndash;2007: PhD in Interactive Systems and Creativity** [Creativity and Cognition Studios](https://www.creativityandcognition.com/), University of Technology Sydney, Australia. I studied the design qualities of no-code software environments used by creative practitioners.
* **1997&ndash;2002: Master of Computer Science**, First Class with Honours, Loughborough University, UK. Many 1s and 0s were flipped.

## Small facts

* I identify as non-binary (which is a very binary thing to claim) and "they/them" pronouns describe me best.
* I've got a collection of neurodiverse superpowers which I like bringing to bear on wicked problems.
* For people who think about human development in colours, I'm roughly a [Yellow](https://spiral-dynamics-quiz.com/stages) -- [find yours here](https://spiral-dynamics-quiz.com/).
* I've lived in Bath, Sydney, San Francisco, Koh Pha Gnan, and currently Melbourne, with my wonderful partner Sarah, and cats Franklin and Mon-Mon.
